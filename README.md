# Rin's Dotfiles

Out dotfiles, for our use, and in case they come in handy for anyone else.

## Notes

- The limits module should be executed with `stow -Sv -t /etc/security/limits.d/`, as it is inteded as a baseline config
  for security limits.
- The waybar module depends on [workstyle](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/workstyle).
- The sway module depends on [rofi-power-menu](https://github.com/jluttine/rofi-power-menu).
- The wal module generates themes for both rofi and [vencord](https://github.com/ZephyrCodesStuff/pywal-vencord).
